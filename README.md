## Instructions  

A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned from ticket sales. The remainder goes to the movie distributor. Write a program that calculates a theater's gross and net box office profit for a night. The program should ask for the name of the movie, and how many adult and child tickets were sold. (An adult ticket is \$10.00, a child's ticket is $6.00.) It should display a report similar to:  

```
Movie Name:                    “Wheels of Fury”             
Adult Tickets Sold:               382  
Child Tickets Sold:               127  
Gross Box Office Profit:       $ 4582.00  
Net Box Office Profit:         $  916.40  
Amount Paid to Distributor:    $ 3665.60
```

Some details to note:  

- Gross Box Office Profit is the total of money made in sales  
- The Net Box Office Profit is the amount of money the theater keeps  
  - Assume the theater keeps 20% of the gross box office profit
- The Amount Paid to Distributor is the difference between the Gross and Net  Box Office Profit  

Notice that:  

- The user data is displayed aligned as a secong column  
- For the currency, the $ as well as the decimal point are aligned
- The name of the movie is displayed _with_ quoatation marks
